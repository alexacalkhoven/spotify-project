1 --> follow spotify/python tutorial
2 --> make actual project of some sort
* Spotify mood ring (mood based off of recent listening)
* AI generated playlist images based on songs in playlist
* Get recently played tracks --> make some graphs off of this (problem: we don't know if the user skipped the song or not)
* Recommend reference material/books/songs based off recently listened to podcasts
